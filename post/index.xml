      <description>Summary
This week Stannis gave a high-level overview of three popular families of deep generative models. The discussion is mainly based on the original papers [1][2]. The goal is to point out the commonalities and differences between these models, and have a detailed discussion on the different learning methods employed by these models.
 Overview When using latent variable models for probabilistic modeling, the objects of interest are the latent variables (which we denote by $z$), and the observed variables (which we denote by $x$).</description>
